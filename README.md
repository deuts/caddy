# Custom Caddy Docker Image with Cloudflare DNS Challenge Support

This repository provides a Dockerfile that builds a custom version of the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) web server, with support for the Cloudflare DNS challenge. This setup is particularly useful for automatically obtaining and renewing SSL/TLS certificates using Cloudflareâ€™s DNS API.

## Why Use This?

When using Caddy's automatic HTTPS capabilities, the HTTP and TLS challenges are sufficient for most use cases. However, if your server is behind a firewall, load balancer, or you don't want to expose port 80/443 to the public internet, the **DNS challenge** is a better option. This Dockerfile extends the official Caddy image by integrating the `xcaddy` tool to build Caddy with the `cloudflare` DNS provider module.

With this setup, you can use Cloudflare's API to verify domain ownership and automatically obtain certificates for your domain(s).

## How It Works

The Dockerfile is composed of two stages:

1. **Builder Stage**: The Caddy executable is built using `xcaddy`, with the Cloudflare DNS module added as a plugin.
2. **Final Stage**: The custom-built Caddy binary is copied into a fresh Caddy image to ensure a lean and production-ready image.

## Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM caddy:builder AS builder

RUN xcaddy build \
    --with github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare

FROM caddy:latest

COPY --from=builder /usr/bin/caddy /usr/bin/caddy
